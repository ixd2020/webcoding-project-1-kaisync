          <p>
            Frida Kahlo was born in July 6th, 1907 in Coyaocan, Mexico as the
            daughter of the talented German photographer Guillermo Kahlo and
            Matilde Calderon who was a mestiza. Her life evolved during a
            historic time in Mexico when the struggle for social change began to
            gain significance. It is noted that she often gave her birth year as
            1910, to be directly associated with the revolution.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kahlo was an inspiring individual who showed great personality and
            devotion to her life. She overcame a severe case of polio in her
            early childhood and had to continue her life with the physical
            effects from the disease. In spite of being disabled by polio, Kahlo
            became an outstanding student, being one of the thirty five women of
            the first generation who attended the National Preparatory School.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1925, Kahlo was traveling on a bus when it crashed into a
            tramcar, severely affecting her life - it was her second close
            encounter with death. Spending several months with limited mobility
            and learning to cope with the boredom of her recover process, Kahlo
            soon began to paint with the water-colours. The incident caused her
            lifelong pain and medical problems, but was also the beginning of
            her development as an artist.
          </p>

          <p>
            Kahlo met fellow Mexican artist
            <a href="display/Freida-and-Diego.html">Diego Rivera</a> through the
            Mexican Communist Party in 1927 due to her interest in politics and
            art, and married him in 1929 before travelling in Mexico and the
            United States in the late 1920s and early 1930s .
          </p>
          <p>
            In this time, Kahlo developed her artistic style by drawing
            inspiration from Mexican folk culture. She also gained great
            opportunities as an artist overseas up till the 1940s, including a
            solo exhibition in New York.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kahlo's always-fragile health began to decline in the same decade.
            She had her first solo exhibition in Mexico in 1953, shortly before
            her death in 1954 at the age of 47.
          </p>

          <p>
            Following her death, Kahlo's work rose in popularity only in the
            late 1970s, when her work was rediscovered by art historians and
            political activists. The message behind her work served as
            inspiration and has been celebrated as in icon by many modern
            movements today.

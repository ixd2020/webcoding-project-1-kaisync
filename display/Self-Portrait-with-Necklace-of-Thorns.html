          >Kahlo depicts herself having unraveled Christ's crown of thorns and
          wearing it as a necklace, presenting herself as a Christian martyr.
          The thorns digging into her neck are symbolic of the pain she still
          feels over her divorce from Diego. Hanging from the thorny necklace is
          a dead hummingbird whose outstretched wings echo Frida's joined
          eyebrows. In Mexican folk tradition, dead hummingbirds were used as
          charms to bring luck in love. Over her left shoulder the black cat, a
          symbol of bad luck and death, waits to pounce on the hummingbird. Over
          her right shoulder the symbol of the devil, her pet monkeyâ€¦a gift from
          Diego. Around her hair, butterflies represent the Resurrection. Once
          again, Frida uses a wall of large tropical plant leaves as the
          background.</em

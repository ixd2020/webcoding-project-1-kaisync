          >Kahlo was 18 years old when she was involved in a horrific traffic
          accident, in which an iron rod pierced her abdomen, right foot was
          crushed, and two vertebrae were fractured, as well as a number of
          other bones, including eleven fractures in her right leg. As she
          recovered in a full body cast, her mother brought her a small lap
          easel, and, with a mirror over her bed, began painting self-portraits.
          This self-portrait embodies many elements that were in Kahlo’s
          artwork, including the themes of isolation, a broken body, and intense
          suffering and pain. This painting also embodies another one of Kahlo’s
          themes, that of two bodies, one of which she is a complete and full
          bodied woman, and another, reflecting broken insides.</em

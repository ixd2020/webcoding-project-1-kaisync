            FRIDA KAHLO
          </h1>
          <p>
            was an artist known for her portraits. Kahlo was her own most
            popular subject, and had other works inspired by Mexican nature and
            artifacts. Kahlo's art was often inspired by either the country's
            popular culture or her own life.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1925, Kahlo was traveling on a bus when it crashed into a
            tramcar, severely injuring her. Spending several months with limited
            mobility and learning to cope with the boredom of her recovery
            process, Kahlo soon began to paint with the water-colours of her
            father, the talented photographer Guillermo Kahlo. Thus her interest
            in becoming an artist grew.
          </p>

          <p>
            Kahlo met fellow Mexican artist
            <a href="display/Frieda-and-Diego.html">Diego Rivera</a> through the
            Mexican Communist Party in 1927 due to her interest in politics and
            art. The two artists got married in 1929, and spent the late 1920s
            and early 1930s travelling in Mexico and the United States.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this time, Kahlo developed her artistic style by drawing
            inspiration from Mexican folk culture. She painted small
            self-portraits with elements from pre-Columbian and Catholic
            beliefs. The work of Kahlo caught the attention of the Surrealist
            artist André Breton who arranged for her first solo exhibition in
            New York in 1938, followed by another exhibition in Paris in 1939.
            The latter was less of a success, however the Louvre purchased
            <a href="display/The-Frame.html">The Frame</a> from Kahlo. She was
            the first Mexican artist to be featured in their collection.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the 1940s, Kahlo participated in Mexican and American art
            exhibitions, and taught art at the Escuela Nacional de Pintura,
            Escultura y Grabado ("La Esmeralda") and was a founding member of
            the Seminario de Cultura Mexicana. Her first solo Mexican exhibition
            was held in 1953, a year before her passing.

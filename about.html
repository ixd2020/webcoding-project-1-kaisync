            FRIDA KAHLO
          </h1>
          <p>
            was born in July 6th, 1907 in Coyaocan, Mexico. Her life evolved
            during a historic tme in Mexico when the struggle for social change
            began to gain significance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having overcame a severe case of polio in her early childhood and
            having to continue her life with the physical effects from the
            disease, and also being one of the thirty five women of the first
            generation who attended the National Preparatory School, Kahlo
            showed great personality and devotion to her life.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1925, Kahlo was traveling on a bus when it crashed into a
            tramcar, severely affecting her life - it was her second close
            encounter with death. Spending several months with limited mobility
            and learning to cope with the boredom of her recover process, Kahlo
            soon began to paint with the water-colours of her father, the
            talented photographer Guillermo Kahlo. Thus her interest in becoming
            an artist grew.
          </p>

          <p>
            Kahlo met fellow Mexican artist
            <a href="Frida-and-Diego.html">Diego Rivera</a> Mexican Communist
            Party in 1927 due to her interest in politics and art. The two
            artists got married in 1929, and spent the late 1920s and early
            1930s travelling in Mexico and the United States.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this time, Kahlo developed her artistic style by drawing
            inspiration from Mexican folk culture. She painted small
            self-portraits with elements from pre-Columbian and Catholic
            beliefs. The work of Kahlo caught the attention of the Surrealist
            artist André Breton who arranged for her first solo exhibition in
            New York in 1938.
